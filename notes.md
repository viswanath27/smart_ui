# UI Components 

This directory contains the source code for the React application.
## src/components
This directory contains reusable UI components used throughout the application. Examples include ChatInput, ChatMessage, and ChatWidget.

## src/pages
This directory contains the individual pages/routes of the application. Each page typically corresponds to a React component that defines the layout and behavior of a specific route. Examples may include HomePage, AboutPage, or ChatPage.

## src/styles
This directory contains CSS or styling files used to customize the appearance of the application.

# Backend components
## src/contexts:(BE)
This directory contains context providers used for managing global state in the application. Notable contexts may include AuthContext, ChatContext, or ThemeContext.

## src/hooks: (BE)
This directory contains custom hooks used to encapsulate reusable logic. Examples may include hooks for handling API requests, managing form state, or implementing chat-related functionality.

## src/services: (BE)
This directory may contain utility functions or services used for data fetching, API communication, or other backend-related tasks.

## src/utils: (BE)
This directory contains utility functions or helper modules that provide common functionality across the application.

## src/App.js or src/index.js: 
These files typically serve as the entry point for the React application, where the root component is rendered and any necessary configurations are applied (such as wrapping the app with a routing provider or a state management provider).
